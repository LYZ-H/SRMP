daml-ha1.0:  Decentralized asynchronous machine learning - heterogenous aware 1.0
1. use coordinator to dynamically change the communication topology
2. each node pull parameters from another one node each clock according to the communication policy
3. each node measure the iteration time and report to coordinator which accounts for generating communication policy
4. without data in /examples/pytorch-cifar/data
5. need run command to generate training dataset like 'python3 cifar10-modification.py --remove-labels 1,2,3'
6. start coordinator  -> start workers
